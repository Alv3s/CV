			"description": "Pool Live AR is an augmented reality tool built mainly for amateur and inexperienced players, predicting in real time the trajectory of the balls. Using a camera as input, images of the playable field are acquired in real time, allowing detection of table boundaries, balls’ and cue position, calculating afterwards the probable trajectory of the white ball as well as other balls. The result is then forwarded to a projector, placed above the table, showing the output result onto the table. This project was featured in many world wide websites such as Gizmodo, T3, Daily Telegraph, FOX 8 News, amongst many others, reaching more than a million and a half views on Youtube",
